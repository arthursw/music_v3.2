# music_v3.2

MS segmentation algorithm based on CNNs. It uses FLAIR and T1 modalities. It needs GPU.

You can use the pipeline directly to segment your data, since trained models are provided. They were trained on MICCAI 2016 and MICCAI 2008 training datasets, both openly available. 

If you want to re-train a model, then refer to the files with the *training addendum.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to set-up and use this pipeline is via Docker: follow the README.md file in the repository Docker_music_v2_v3.2.
